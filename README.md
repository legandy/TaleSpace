# City of Tales. Saint-Petersburg. 19th Century

The Project aims to give a view on the system of different types of organizations existed in Saint-Petersburg in the 19th century. The map developed under the Project gives an opportunity to reconstruct the daily life of the pre-revolutionary Saint-Petersburg embodied into governmental and private institutions. By playing with filters, professionals and those who are interested in history are able to see the areas of artistic market, restaurants, taverns and also areas of enlightening activities represented by libraries and museums. The map demonstrates overlaps and relations between different actors of the urban infrastructure.

The Project is based on the data provided by the official Address Book of Saint-Petersburg issued in 1987. This particular issue was chosen because it is considered to be the most complete and elaborated collection of addresses that was also associated with the authoritative ?Berliner Adressbuch? by the developers of that time. The data comprises organizations systematized by the type, its addresses, names and owners.

As for the further perspective, the Project is designed to unite specialists from different areas, who can collaborate and improve the map by marking new groups of addresses they are interested in. Thus, the map will give a rich visual historical representation of the city, it will help to improve the knowledge about the past and answer the questions about the correlation of different business networks in the city of that period.
